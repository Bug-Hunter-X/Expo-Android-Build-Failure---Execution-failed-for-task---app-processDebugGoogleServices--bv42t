This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app.  The build process fails with an error message similar to `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugGoogleServices`. This error is often caused by an incompatibility between the Google services Gradle plugin and other dependencies in your project, or a corrupted or incorrectly configured `google-services.json` file.  It can manifest in various ways, from missing files to incorrect configurations.

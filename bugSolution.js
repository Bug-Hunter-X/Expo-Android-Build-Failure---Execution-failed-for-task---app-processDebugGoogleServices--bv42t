The solution often involves meticulously examining your `google-services.json` file and ensuring it's correctly placed in the `android/app` directory. Double-check the contents for any inaccuracies. Next, carefully review your `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/build.gradle` files for conflicts in the Google Services plugin version and other dependencies.   Cleaning the project using `expo prebuild --clean` or the Android Studio equivalent can also resolve temporary file conflicts. Additionally, confirming you have the correct and up-to-date Android SDK and build tools is essential. If conflicts persist, consider creating a new Expo project and gradually migrating your code to isolate the source of the problem.  If you are using Firebase, ensure your Firebase project settings are properly linked to your app.
